After creating the utility, it became a good place to store other string operations (like creating a hash, md5 or base64).\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nNo tests have been set up for this project.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThis library is provided \"as-is\" and totally free to use. No support comes with it. If you want to make a contribution or include a new feature, you can create a pull request. I will reserve the right to update this package as new requirements become available.   \r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 JohnnyBeProgramming - http://www.prototyped.info\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
